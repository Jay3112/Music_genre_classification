# Music_genre_classification
•	Used basic machine learning libraries such as, keras, scikit learn and pandas for data visualization and management of data.
•	Data was in the form of audio files and extracted features using librosa library.
•	Purpose was to explore how to work with the audio inputs in machine learning algorithms. We have used SVM, KNN, and Decision tree algorithm for classification of music genre.
